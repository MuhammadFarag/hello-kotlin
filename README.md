# Hello Kotlin

Discovering Kotlin coming from Scala.

What I have found that is intersting so far:
- main method (entry point to the program) doesn't need to be in an object.
- we define a function using `fun` instead of `def`
- String interpolation, it is similar to Scala except that you don't need to use 's' character before the opening qoute. In Scala `println(s"hello $name")` in Kotlin  `println("hello $name")`.
